# subLength

subLength is a program I wrote as part of the Codecademy Full Stack Engineer Path. 

The program measures the distance between a pair of matching characters within a string. Per the prompt guidelines, the distance measurement includes the matching characters and parameter inputs that don't have exactly one pair of matching characters return 0.
